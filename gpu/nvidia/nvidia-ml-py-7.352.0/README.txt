------------------------------------------------
Python bindings to the NVIDIA Management Library
------------------------------------------------

Provides a Python interface to GPU management and monitoring functions.

This is a wrapper around the NVML library.
For information about the NVML library, see the NVML developer page
http://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml

Download the latest package from:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nvidia-ml-py/

Note this file can be run with 'python -m doctest -v README.txt'
although the results are system dependent

REQUIRES
--------
Python 2.5, or an earlier version with the ctypes module.

INSTALLATION
------------
sudo python setup.py install

USAGE
-----

    >>> from pynvml import *
    >>> nvmlInit()
    >>> print "Driver Version:", nvmlSystemGetDriverVersion()
    Driver Version: 352.00
    >>> deviceCount = nvmlDeviceGetCount()
    >>> for i in range(deviceCount):
    ...     handle = nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(i)
    ...     print "Device", i, ":", nvmlDeviceGetName(handle)
    ... 
    Device 0 : Tesla K40c
    
    >>> nvmlShutdown()

Additionally, see nvidia_smi.py.  A sample application.

FUNCTIONS
---------
Python methods wrap NVML functions, implemented in a C shared library.
Each function's use is the same with the following exceptions:

- Instead of returning error codes, failing error codes are raised as 
  Python exceptions.

    >>> try:
    ...     nvmlDeviceGetCount()
    ... except NVMLError as error:
    ...     print error
    ... 
    Uninitialized

- C function output parameters are returned from the corresponding
  Python function left to right.

::
    
    nvmlReturn_t nvmlDeviceGetEccMode(nvmlDevice_t device,
                                      nvmlEnableState_t *current,
                                      nvmlEnableState_t *pending);

    >>> nvmlInit()
    >>> handle = nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex(0)
    >>> (current, pending) = nvmlDeviceGetEccMode(handle)

- C structs are converted into Python classes.

::
    
    nvmlReturn_t DECLDIR nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo(nvmlDevice_t device,
                                                 nvmlMemory_t *memory);
    typedef struct nvmlMemory_st {
        unsigned long long total;
        unsigned long long free;
        unsigned long long used;
    } nvmlMemory_t;

    >>> info = nvmlDeviceGetMemoryInfo(handle)
    >>> print "Total memory:", info.total
    Total memory: 5636292608
    >>> print "Free memory:", info.free
    Free memory: 5578420224
    >>> print "Used memory:", info.used
    Used memory: 57872384

- Python handles string buffer creation.

::
    
    nvmlReturn_t nvmlSystemGetDriverVersion(char* version,
                                            unsigned int length);

    >>> version = nvmlSystemGetDriverVersion();
    >>> nvmlShutdown()

For usage information see the NVML documentation.

VARIABLES
---------
All meaningful NVML constants and enums are exposed in Python.

The NVML_VALUE_NOT_AVAILABLE constant is not used.  Instead None is mapped to the field.
